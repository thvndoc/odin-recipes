            <li>1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce</li>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <p>You will also need: 2 Large Baking Sheets, 1 Cooling Rack, 1 Pastry Brush</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190°C (375°F)</li>
            <li>Season the chicken wings with the salt, garlic powder and pepper.</li>
            <li>Spray a baking sheet lightly with cooking spray. Place the chicken wings, in a single layer, on the baking sheet. Bake them for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the wings from the oven. Line a clean baking sheet with a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Spray the cooling rack lightly with cooking spray. Arrange the chicken wings, in a single layer, on the cooling rack, skin side up. Bake them for 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>While the wings continue to cook, make the sauce</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the barbecue sauce, brown sugar, honey, ketchup, mustard and Worcestershire sauce to a saucepan. Heat the barbecue sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid sticking.</li>
            <li>Simmer the sauce for a few minutes, until the sugar melts and the ingredients are incorporated. Give the sauce all of your attention while it’s simmering! Do not leave the pan unattended.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to low and keep the sauce warm until ready to use, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add about ¾ of the sauce to a bowl and reserve the rest for serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Coat the wings with the barbecue sauce</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the wings from the oven and turn each one so the paler side is up. Brush them with a generous amount of the barbecue sauce and bake for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Again, remove them from the oven and turn each wing. Brush them with a thick layer of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Return the wings to the oven and bake another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Without turning them this time, sauce them one final time and bake for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Arrange the chicken wings on a platter serve them with the remaining barbecue sauce on the side.</li>
        </ol>
